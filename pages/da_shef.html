                    The digital menu for restaurants and bars streamlines the ordering process through a
                    user-friendly application, providing guests with comprehensive information
                    about meals, including ingredients, preparation methods, and more.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    A standout feature is the ability for guests to view the estimated preparation and
                    cooking times, as well as receive real-time updates when their meal is ready to be served.
                </p>

                    This was my first project as software engineer with the focus on the backend, and that was
                    the moment when I choose to continue in that direction later.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                    On the project I worked alone, but I had great colleagues that supported when I needed the help,
                    I still was a junior software engineer and I learned much from them.

                <p class="mb-2">
                    Also, I could say it was one of my favorite applications in my long carrier.
