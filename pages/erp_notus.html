                  Working in Notus in ERP team was really great, and there I had the best mentor in my carrier.

                  Working on ERP modules and project I was in touch with the biggest databases, over 1800 tables,
                  which was really challenging to write optimized and great queries, especially for really important
                  reports for accounting.

              <p class="mb-0">
                  I am honored to work on the first module for salaries for Croatia, and here I learned about something
                  that could help me in case I have my own company.

                Unfortunately this team was the smallest, but was really efficient.
